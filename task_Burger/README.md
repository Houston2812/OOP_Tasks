# Burger Menu
In this program 2 patters are used:  
* Composite  
* Facade  
  
This solution impelements the menu of a restaurant, where clients are able to choose between 2 possible menus:  
* Small Menu
* Big Menu

Menu is generated in the MenuController, that implements Facade Patters and each itself is constructed via Composite Pattern.
